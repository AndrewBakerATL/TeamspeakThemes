Automatic Installation

1. Execute the installer of your preferred Talk Icons.
├─ 1 - Default Talk Icon = DarkenTS Default
├─ 2 - Circular Talk Icon = Circular Talk Icons in DarkenTS Default colour scheme
├─ 3 - Ringular Talk Icon = Alternative Circular Talk Icons variation
├── Windows users, please execute "[X].1 - Install [X] Talk Icon.bat" (Don't worry if you do not see the ".bat".) | Tested on Windows 7, Windows 10
├── Linux users, you probably know better than me what to do. The files should be executable via "sh" or double-click if supported by the system. | Tested on Ubuntu 16.04
└── Mac users, please execute "[X].1 - Install [X] Talk Icon.command". Depending on your access privileges you have to edit those before being able to use the file. Depending on your Shell Profile setting you have to manually close the terminal window. | Tested on macOS 10.12 Sierra
2. If open, restart TeamSpeak.
3. Enjoy!

If you have any feedback to the Automatic Installation process, please contact me via the links available in the Feedback directory, especially the Mac solution seems to be a little too "absolute" in my opinion; I am no Linux user either, so problems might occur with those "installation" files.
